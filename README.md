# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project applies **logistic regression** on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify tumors as **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)**. It covers preprocessing, model training, evaluation with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC), and optional threshold tuning.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **File:** `data.csv`
- **Target:** `diagnosis` (M = malignant, B = benign)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Steps Covered
- Load and inspect data
- Encode target labels
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Train/test split (80-20)
- Logistic Regression training
- Evaluation (confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve)
- Threshold tuning (optional)

---

## 📊 Outcome
The model shows **high predictive performance** with strong accuracy and AUC score.  
Visualizations like the **confusion matrix** and **ROC curve** help understand classification quality.  
The project is suitable for extension into more complex models like Random Forest or SVM.
